    <h2>Hi! I'm Christiana.</h2>
    <p>
      In everything I do, I approach challenges with a systems-thinking mindset—balancing analytical precision with the ability to think big picture.
      I thrive in interdisciplinary environments, where I can collaborate with experts from diverse fields to discuss complex problems.
      I place great value on understanding the people I work with, learning what drives them, and ensuring we align on a shared vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a student researcher and teammate, I prioritize asking the right questions and never settle for incomplete explanations.
      My goal is to develop solutions that are functionally refined and well thought out. I am also deeply interested in understanding the compromises that must be made during the design process—how to allocate time and resources effectively, as well as managing both the project and team dynamics.
      I excel at identifying the best person for each task and am skilled at initiating networking to overcome knowledge gaps and collaborate across disciplines.
    </p>
